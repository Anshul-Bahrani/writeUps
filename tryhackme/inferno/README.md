Oh quanto parve a me gran maraviglia
quand'io vidi tre facce a la sua testa!
L'una dinanzi, e quella era vermiglia;

l'altr'eran due, che s'aggiugnieno a questa
sovresso 'l mezzo di ciascuna spalla,
e se' giugnieno al loco de la cresta

Translated:

Oh how great a surprise it seemed to me
when I saw three faces in his head!
One before, and that was vermilion;

the other two were added to this one
over the middle of each shoulder,
and if you reach the place of the crest
