|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2015-1635
|       A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP protocol stack (HTTP.sys) that is
|       caused when HTTP.sys improperly parses specially crafted HTTP requests. An attacker who
|       successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of the System account.

|     State: VULNERABLE (Exploitable)
|       This web server contains password protected resources vulnerable to authentication bypass
|       vulnerabilities via HTTP verb tampering. This is often found in web servers that only limit access to the
|        common HTTP methods and in misconfigured .htaccess files.

|   Slowloris DOS attack
|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.
