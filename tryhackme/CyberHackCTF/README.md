I was one of the finalists for Hackquest 1.0

TCS Hackquest is a Campus Level Technical competition similar to other Capture the Flag(CTF) events conducted across the globe. The event is entirely dedicated to Ethical Hacking where we have to find the vulnerabilities and report them to using a report template provided by TCS

Primarly two things are needed for Participating in Hackquest

    Interest towards ethical Hacking
    Intermediate Knowledge in Web Application Pentesting

To Prepare I would like to have an idea on Hacking alongside

    OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities (Firm Level of Knowledge on This)
    Knowledge in Using Burpsuite (Youtube Tutorial)
    Idea about PHP Vulnerabilities, Most probably you will be getting a PHP Hosted application

During the time, I would like you test some of the sample vulnerable web application like BWAPP to improve your skill and a Quick reference link from github

And the footnote. Its not all about finding bugs, but reporting them.

All the best.
